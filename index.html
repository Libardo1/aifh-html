        <h1>Artificial Intelligence for Humans</h1>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence for Humans (AIFH) is a series of books that is currently under development.  At this point I am writing Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms.  The plan is to release this volume sometime in December 2013.  Volume 1 was launched through a successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jeffheaton/artificial-intelligence-for-humans-vol-1-fund-algo">Kickstarter campaign.</a></p>  
        <p>The book series teaches Artificial Intelligence concepts in a mathematically gentle manor.  What exactly do I mean by mathematically gentle?</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I assume the reader is proficient in at least one programming language.
			<li>I assume the reader has a basic understanding of College Algebra.
			<li>I do use topics and formulas from Calculus, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations and Statistics.  
			<li>However, when explaining topics in bullet point 3, I always assume the reader is at the level of the first two bullets above.
			<li>I always follow concepts with real-world programming examples and pseudo code.  Not just mathematical formulas.
			<li>The books stay at the pseudo code level.
			<li>Example packs are provided for: Java, C#, R, C/C++ and Python.
			<li>The community is encouraged to help port to other languages!

        <h1>AIFH Volumes</h1>
    	<p>My books are frequently read on electronic devices. There are many Javascript examples that help illustrate points from the book.  Think of this as a sort of Javascript AI Lab. These examples are all contained on this website. This allows you to play with the algorithms and see how they work. This also provides Javascript as another language you can examine the examples in. You can access these examples from direct links embedded in the books.  You can also see the examples from links below.</p>
    	<h2>Volume 0: Introduction to the Math of AI</h2>
    	<p>This book will review, and expand upon, mathematical concepts covered in the other volumes. No it will not be written first. It is essentially a planned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel">prequel</a>. I do not yet know the full range of mathematical topics I will cover.</p>
		<h2><a href="./vol1">Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms</a></h2>
		<p>To have a great building you must have a great foundation. This book teaches Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as dimensionality, distance metrics, clustering, error calculation, Hebb's rule, the Delta Rule, hill climbing and linear regression. These algorithms allow you to process and recognize patterns in data.  This is how sites such as Amazon and NetFlix suggest products to you.  
		<p>These are not just foundational algorithms for the rest of the series. These algorithms are very useful in their own right. All algorithms are explained with actual numeric calculations that you can perform yourself.

		<h2>Volume 2: Evolutionary Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 3: Neural Networks</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 4: Support Vector Machines</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 5: Probability</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
