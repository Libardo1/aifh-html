        <h1>AIFH Series Javascript Labs</h1>
    	<p>This website holds Javascript labs for my <a href="about.html">series of books on Artificial Intelligence</a>.  My books are frequently read on electronic devices. There are many Javascript examples that help illustrate points from the book.  Think of this as a sort of Javascript AI Lab. These examples are all contained on this website. This allows you to play with the algorithms and see how they work. This also provides Javascript as another language you can examine the examples in. This site is very much a work in progress and you will see additional labs added in the future.</p>
    	<h2>Volume 0: Introduction to the Math of AI</h2>
    	<p>This book will review, and expand upon, mathematical concepts covered in the other volumes. No it will not be written first. It is essentially a planned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel">prequel</a>. I do not yet know the full range of mathematical topics I will cover.</p>
		<h2><a href="./vol1">Volume 1: Fundamental Algorithms</a></h2>
		<p>To have a great building you must have a great foundation. This book teaches Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as dimensionality, distance metrics, clustering, error calculation, Hebb's rule, the Delta Rule, hill climbing and linear regression. These algorithms allow you to process and recognize patterns in data.  This is how sites such as Amazon and NetFlix suggest products to you.  
		<p>These are not just foundational algorithms for the rest of the series. These algorithms are very useful in their own right. All algorithms are explained with actual numeric calculations that you can perform yourself.
		<p>Click the book title above for more information.</p>
		<h2>Volume 2: Evolutionary Algorithms</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 3: Neural Networks</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 4: Support Vector Machines</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
		<h2>Volume 5: Probability</h2>
		<p>Book planned for the future.</p>
